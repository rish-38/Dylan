    <div class="col">
      <p>
        Dylan is a fashion brand inspired by the sea, embodying timeless style and elegance. The name Dylan, meaning
        "forever flowing" and "born from the sea," reflects its connection to the ever-changing yet enduring nature of
        the ocean. The logo is designed using the Maberk font, with a creative twist where the letter "A" is replaced by
        a wave-shaped symbol, tying the brand closely to its ocean-inspired essence. The tagline, "Ride the Waves,"
        encourages individuals to embrace trends effortlessly, staying fashionable with confidence and grace. The
        brands color palette enhances its identity, featuring Dark Slate Blue (#264257) to signify the tranquility and
        versatility of the sea and sky, Light Blue (#C5DEE2) to evoke serenity, Bright Orange (#FD6941) for a burst of
        energy and vibrancy, and White (#FFFFFF) for timeless simplicity. Together, these elements create a visual and
        conceptual harmony, positioning Dylan as a brand that blends modern trends with classic appeal, making it a
        strong competitor to fashion giants like Zara.

        <strong>Script for DYLAN Video Ad: "Ride the Waves of Fashion"</strong>
        <br>
        [<strong>Scene 1:</strong> Therapy Room](chaotic, minimalist aesthetic. Patient sits on a chair across from the doctor. The
        atmosphere has a little tension.)
        <br>
        <strong>Doctor:</strong>"What seems to be the problem you're facing?"
        <br>
        <strong>Patient:</strong>(Looks unsure, hesitant at first, then looks down at the doctor. And then towards the camera)"I'm
        searching for something… new, fashionable."
        <br>
        [<strong>Scene 2:</strong> Search Montage](The patient is now in their own world, sitting at a desk, typing on a laptop. The
        camera focuses on their hands typing keywords: "Fashion," "Trendy Clothes," "Stylish Outfits," and "Something
        that looks good on me.")
        <br>
        (Quick flashes of social media Post, online shops, and fashion inspirations flood the screen, building
        excitement.)
        <br>
        [<strong>Scene 3:</strong> Back to Therapy Room](The camera pans back to the therapy room. The doctor leans forward slightly
        Backward and plays the strums Guitar.)
        <br>
        <strong>Doctor: </strong>"And… anything else you can think of?"
        <br>
        <strong>Patient:</strong>(Pauses, furrows brows, trying to recall something.)"I… I think there’s more."
        <br>
        [Scene 4: Patient's Memory (POV Shot)](The screen blurs momentarily, transitioning

    <div class="col2">
      <p>
        into the patient’s memory. The POV camera shows
        That he wake in between he walk in park and finds a note in his pocket and its written that “Open it” and he
        opens the note and it say “It’s here” with little map drawing. patient starts walking and he finds the shirts .

        for? Can you recall now?" so have you find it ?
        <br>
        [ <strong>Scene 6: </strong> Narrator Voiceover and Visuals](The camera zooms out to show the patient standing confidently, now
        fully dressed in DYLAN’s latest outfit. They look trendy and self-assured.)

        <br>
        (The screen fades to black with the DYLAN logo and tagline "Ride the waves" displayed prominently. Ambient wave
        sounds play softly in the background.)
